## Introduction
In today's interconnected world, travel has become an essential part of our lives, offering opportunities for exploration and creating cherished memories. However, the complexities of planning and the expenses associated with travel can be daunting. Introducing Journey Buddy, a mobile app designed to address this challenge.

Journey Buddy simplifies the travel experience. Unlike other apps, it will offer a comprehensive platform where users can share their travel stories, book trips, follow pre-planned journeys, and take part in live activities.

## Used Technologies
Developed using React Native and Firebase Cloud, Journey Buddy prioritizes a user-friendly interface, drawing inspiration from Instagram.

Firebase was chosen as a cloud solution mostly for its ease of use on small apps and prototypes while still providing features such as:
- Authentication
- Bucket Storage
- Cloud database

## How's development going?
During my recent Mobile Applications Development course, I created Journey Buddy from scratch, focusing on crowd-sourced travel guides. 

Notable features include:
- Photo-based location suggestions, which use metadata to recommend places for user-generated guides. 
- Seamless navigation with infinite scrolling on the homepage.
- Saving guides, mapping them, commenting, rating, following users.
- Cached images with placeholders.

## Next-Steps
Future enhancements will introduce Async storage, guide reporting, notifications, landmarks-based exploration, and guide following with directions, making Journey Buddy an even more valuable tool for travellers. As an aspiring software engineer, I'm committed to delivering a product that enhances people's travel experiences and sparks their passion for exploration, photography, and design.

I believe this app holds vast potential for further growth and development.

## Suggestions
I eagerly await your valuable suggestions and feedback as I work towards realizing this vision.
